    <h1>Juniper Hibiscus / Hawthorn Berry and Flower Semi-Sweet Mead</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    If memory serves me right, it was Olaf Haraldsson who once said:
    <p>"Too much mead and a man's heart is laid open for all to see"
    </p>
    As it so happens I do wish to see your heart lay open, so here goes a <strong>Semi-Sweet Mead</strong> recipe!
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart (about 2.3 pounds) Wildflower honey;</li>
        <li>1 gal Spring water;</li>
        <li>1 oz. Dried juniper berries;</li>
        <li>1 oz. Dried hibiscus flowers or 2 oz. fresh;</li>
        <li>0.5 oz. Meadowsweet;</li>
        <li>0.5 oz. Yarrow</li>
        <li>4-5 Raisins</li>
        <li>¼ - ½ cup Wild mead starter or 1 packet (5 g) of Lalvin D-47 or Lalvin 71-B</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol> <li>Mix honey with water into a stockpot over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Stir thoroughly until the honey dissolves fully.</li>
        <li>Using a funnel, pour the mead must into a one-gallon carboy.</li>
        <li>Add the juniper berries, hibiscus flowers, meadowsweet, yarrow, and raisins.</li>
        <li>Cover the vessel with an airlock half full of water inserted into a cork.</li>
        <li>Place the vessel in a warm, dark area to allow fermentation for at least one month.</li>
        <li>After a month, your mead will clarify but will still be too sweet and less alcoholic. To help continue its aging and achieve a more clarified mead with high alcohol content, rack the mixture into another container.</li>
        <li>Rack again at least two times, every two to three months, until you have a clear mead with minimal sediment on the bottom of the carboy.</li>
        <li>The next step is to bottle the mead. Typically, a one-gallon batch should be ready for bottling in about four to six months. For you to know if it’s time to bottle, drop a bit of sugar into the mead or stir it carefully. If it produces bubbles, then it means that the mead is still fermenting. You may also try to place a lid on the container and wait for a few days before gently opening it. If you hear any fizzing sound, the mead is still fermenting.</li>
        <li>Bottle the mead using wine bottles, beer bottles, or flip-top bottles with new caps. Let it age for at least six months to one year.</li>
    </ol>
