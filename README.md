HTML - Recipe Website Practice
Welcome. This is the first version of my very own first website.
This is a project, for I am a student enrolled in the Odin Project open course.
Creating a website will make me practice some very basic HTML concepts, which I will enhance in the future as I learn CSS and eventually JavaScript.
I'll try to keep my commit atomic and make sure I create a very thorough list of my progress, both for me and for my dear future employers.

Today is 04.04.22.
 Enjoy the recipes!
