    <h1> Four leaf clover bread</h1>    
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    Is your viking husband about to ransack a nearby fishing village? There is no better way to wish him good luck than baking him a <strong>Four Leaf Clover Bread!</strong>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2> 
    <p>For this recipe, we are going to need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 dl barley flour;</li>
        <li>0.5 dl graham flour;</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons crushed flax seeds;</li>
        <li>1 dl water;</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp lard</li>
        <li>1 krm salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>    
        <li>Mix the ingredients into a dough that is allowed to rest cold for two days. The breads then become smoother, darker and tastier than if they are baked out immediately.</li>
        <li>Thumb out 8 round loaves, make four pinches in the sides so that the loaf looks like a four-leaf clover.</li>
        <li>Make three small impressions as decoration on the top. Bake in the oven at 150 degrees for 10-13 minutes or in a pan over an open fire (the result can then be a little uneven).</li>
    </ol>
    Wholemeal flour with both sprouts and skins gives a richer taste that matches better with the Viking-era original bread. Because the bread is unfermented, it becomes quite hard and compact.
